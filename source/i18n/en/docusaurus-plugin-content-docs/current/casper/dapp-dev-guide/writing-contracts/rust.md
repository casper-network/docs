# Rust

This section explains step by step how to write a new smart contract on Casper. Start with `main.rs` from the previous section.

## A Basic Smart Contract in Rust {#a-basic-smart-contract-in-rust}

The Casper VM executes a smart contract by calling the `call` function specified in the contract. If the function is missing, the smart contract is not valid. The simplest possible example is an empty `call` function.

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {}
```

The `#[no_mangle]` attribute prevents the compiler from changing (mangling) the function name when converting to the binary format of Wasm. Without it, the VM exits with the error message: `Module doesn't have export call`.

## Arguments {#arguments}

It's possible to pass arguments to smart contracts. To leverage this feature, use [runtime::get_named_arg](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/runtime/fn.get_named_arg.html).

```rust
use casperlabs_contract::contract_api::runtime;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {
    let value: String = runtime::get_named_arg("value");
}
```

## Storage {#storage}

Saving and reading values to and from the blockchain is a manual process in Casper. It requires more code to be written, but also provides a lot of flexibility. The storage system works similarly to a file system in an operating system. Let's say we have a string `"Hello Casper!"` that needs to be saved. To do this, use the text editor, create a new file, paste the string in and save it under a name in some directory. The pattern is similar on the Casper blockchain. First you have to save your value to the memory using [storage::new_uref](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/storage/fn.new_uref.html). This returns a reference to the memory object that holds the `"Hello Casper!"` value. You could use this reference to update the value to something else. It's like a file. Secondly you have to save the reference under a human-readable string using [runtime::put_key](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/runtime/fn.put_key.html). It's like giving a name to the file. The following function implements this scenario:

```rust
const KEY: &str = "special_value";

fn store(value: String) {
    // Store `value` under a new unforgeable reference.
    let value_ref = storage::new_uref(value);

    // Wrap the unforgeable reference in a `Key`.
    let value_key: Key = value_ref.into();

    // Store this key under the name "special_value" in context-local storage.
    runtime::put_key(KEY, value_key);
}
```

After this function is executed, the context (Account or Smart Contract) will have the content of the `value` stored under `KEY` in its named keys space. The named keys space is a key-value storage that every context has. It's like a home directory.

## Final Smart Contract {#final-smart-contract}

The code below is the simple contract generated by [cargo-casper](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-casper) (found in `contract/src/main.rs` of a project created by the tool). It reads an argument and stores it in the memory under a key named `"special_value"`.

```rust
#![cfg_attr(
    not(target_arch = "wasm32"),
    crate_type = "target arch should be wasm32"
)]
#![no_main]

use casperlabs_contract::{
    contract_api::{runtime, storage},
};
use casperlabs_types::{Key, URef};

const KEY: &str = "special_value";
const ARG_MESSAGE: &str = "message";

fn store(value: String) {
    // Store `value` under a new unforgeable reference.
    let value_ref: URef = storage::new_uref(value);

    // Wrap the unforgeable reference in a value of type `Key`.
    let value_key: Key = value_ref.into();

    // Store this key under the name "special_value" in context-local storage.
    runtime::put_key(KEY, value_key);
}

// All session code must have a `call` entrypoint.
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {
    // Get the optional first argument supplied to the argument.
    let value: String = runtime::get_named_arg(ARG_MESSAGE);
    store(value);
}
```

## Using Error Codes {#using-error-codes}

The Casper VM supports error codes in smart contracts. A contract can stop execution and exit with a given error via the [runtime::revert](https://docs.rs/casper-contract) function:

```rust
use casperlabs_contract::contract_api::runtime;
use casperlabs_types::ApiError;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {
    runtime::revert(ApiError::PermissionDenied)
}
```

<!-- Casper has [several built-in error variants](https://crates.io/crates/casper-types/latest/casper_types/) , but it's possible to create a custom set of error codes for your smart contract. These can be passed to [runtime::revert](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/runtime/fn.revert.html) via [ApiError::User(\<your error code>) \<https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/enum.ApiError.html#variant.User>](). -->

When a contract exits with an error code, the exit code is visible in the Block Explorer.

### Tests {#tests}

As part of the Casper local environment we provide the in-memory virtual machine you can run your contract against. The testing framework is designed to be used in the following way:

1.  Initialize the context.
2.  Deploy or call the smart contract.
3.  Query the context for changes and assert the result data matches expected values.

## TestContext {#testcontext}

A [TestContext](https://docs.rs/casper-engine-test-support/latest/casper_engine_test_support/struct.TestContext.html) provides a virtual machine instance. It should be a mutable object as we will change its internal data while making deploys. It's also important to set an initial balance for the account to use for deploys.

```rust
const MY_ACCOUNT: [u8; 32] = [7u8; 32];

let mut context = TestContextBuilder::new()
    .with_account(MY_ACCOUNT, U512::from(128_000_000))
    .build();
```

Account is type of `[u8; 32]`. Balance is type of `U512`.

## Run Smart Contract {#run-smart-contract}

Before we can deploy the contract to the context, we need to prepare the request. We call the request a [Session](https://docs.rs/casper-engine-test-support/latest/casper_engine_test_support/struct.Session.html). Each session call should have 4 elements:

-   Wasm file path.
-   List of arguments.
-   Account context of execution.

\* List of keys that authorize the call. See: TODO insert keys management link. .. code-block:: rust

> let VALUE: &str = "hello world"; let session_code = Code::from("contract.wasm"); let session_args = runtime_args! { "value" => VALUE, }; let session = SessionBuilder::new(session_code, session_args) .with_address(MY_ACCOUNT) .with_authorization_keys(&\[MY_ACCOUNT\]) .build(); context.run(session);

Executing `run` will panic if the code execution fails.

## Query and Assert {#query-and-assert}

The smart contract we deployed creates a new value `"hello world"` under the key `"special_value"`. Using the `query` function it's possible to extract this value from the blockchain.

```rust
let KEY: &str = "special_value";
let result_of_query: Result<Value, Error> = context.query(MY_ACCOUNT, &[KEY]);
let returned_value = result_of_query.expect("should be a value");
let expected_value = Value::from_t(VALUE.to_string()).expect("should construct Value");
assert_eq!(expected_value, returned_value);
```

Note that the `expected_value` is a `String` type lifted to the `Value` type. It was also possible to map `returned_value` to the `String` type.

## Final Test {#final-test}

The code below is the simple test generated by [cargo-casper](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-casper) (found in `tests/src/integration_tests.rs` of a project created by the tool).

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use casperlabs_engine_test_support::{Code, Error, SessionBuilder, TestContextBuilder, Value};
    use casperlabs_types::{RuntimeArgs, runtime_args, U512};

    const MY_ACCOUNT: [u8; 32] = [7u8; 32];
    // define KEY constant to match that in the contract
    const KEY: &str = "special_value";
    const VALUE: &str = "hello world";

    #[test]
    fn should_store_hello_world() {
        let mut context = TestContextBuilder::new()
            .with_account(MY_ACCOUNT, U512::from(128_000_000))
            .build();

        // The test framework checks for compiled Wasm files in '<current working dir>/wasm'.  Paths
        // relative to the current working dir (e.g. 'wasm/contract.wasm') can also be used, as can
        // absolute paths.
        let session_code = Code::from("contract.wasm");
        let session_args = runtime_args! {
            "value" => VALUE,
        };
        let session = SessionBuilder::new(session_code, session_args)
            .with_address(MY_ACCOUNT)
            .with_authorization_keys(&[MY_ACCOUNT])
            .build();

        let result_of_query: Result<Value, Error> = context.run(session).query(MY_ACCOUNT, &[KEY]);

        let returned_value = result_of_query.expect("should be a value");

        let expected_value = Value::from_t(VALUE.to_string()).expect("should construct Value");
        assert_eq!(expected_value, returned_value);
    }
}

fn main() {
    panic!("Execute "cargo test" to test the contract, not "cargo run".");
}
```

### WASM File Size {#wasm-file-size}

We encourage shrinking the WASM file size as much as possible. Smaller deploys cost less and save the network bandwidth. We recommend reading [Shrinking .wasm Code Size](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/code-size.md) chapter of [The Rust Wasm Book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).
