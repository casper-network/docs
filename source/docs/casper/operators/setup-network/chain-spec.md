# The Blockchain Specification {#the-chain-specification}

The blockchain specification, or `chainspec`, is a collection of configuration settings describing the network state at genesis and upgrades to basic system functionality (including system contracts and gas costs) occurring after genesis. This page describes each field in the chainspec, based on [version 1.5.2](https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node/blob/release-1.5.2/resources/production/chainspec.toml) of the Casper node. The chainspec can and should be customized for private networks. The chainspec attributes are divided into categories based on what they are configuring.

## protocol

These settings describe the active protocol version. 

|Attribute         |Description                                    | Mainnet Setting |
|----------------- |-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|version          | The Casper node protocol version. | '1.5.2'|
|hard_reset       | When set to true, clear blocks and deploys back to the switch block (the end of the last era) just before the activation point. Used during the upgrade process to reset the network progress. In most cases, this setting should be true.| true|
|activation_point | The protocol version that should become active. <br /><br />If it is a timestamp string, it represents the timestamp for the genesis block. This is the beginning of Era 0. By this time, a sufficient majority (> 50% + F/2 — see the `finality_threshold_fraction` below) of validator nodes must be running to start the blockchain. This timestamp is also used in seeding the pseudo-random number generator used in the contract runtime for computing the genesis post-state hash. <br /><br />If it is an integer, it represents an era ID, meaning the protocol version becomes active at the start of this era. | 9100|


## network

The following settings configure the networking layer.

|Attribute         |Description                                    | Mainnet Setting |
|----------------- |-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|name | Human readable network name for convenience. The state_root_hash of the genesis block is the true identifier. The name influences the genesis hash by contributing to seeding the pseudo-random number generator used in the contract runtime for computing the genesis post-state hash. | 'casper'|
|maximum_net_message_size | The maximum size of an acceptable networking message in bytes. Any message larger than this will be rejected at the networking level. | 25_165_824|

## core

These settings manage the core protocol behavior.

|Attribute         |Description                                    | Mainnet Setting |
|----------------- |-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|era_duration | Era duration. | '120min'|
|minimum_era_height | Minimum number of blocks per era. An era will take longer than `era_duration` if that is necessary to reach the minimum height. | 20 | 
|minimum_block_time | Minimum difference between a block's and its child's timestamp. | '16384ms'|
|validator_slots | Number of slots available in the validator auction. | 100|
|finality_threshold_fraction | A number between 0 and 1 representing the fault tolerance threshold as a fraction used by the internal finalizer.<br />It is the fraction of validators that would need to equivocate to make two honest nodes see two conflicting blocks as finalized.<br />Let's say this value is F. A higher value F makes it safer to rely on finalized blocks. It also makes it more difficult to finalize blocks, however, and requires strictly more than (F + 1)/2 validators to be working correctly. | [1, 3]|
|start_protocol_version_with_strict<br />_finality_signatures_required |Protocol version from which nodes are required to hold strict finality signatures.| '1.5.0'|
|legacy_required_finality|The finality required for legacy blocks. Options are 'Strict', 'Weak', and 'Any'. <br />Used to determine finality sufficiency for new joiners syncing blocks created in a protocol version before the start protocol version with strict finality signatures. |'Strict'|
|auction_delay | Number of eras before an auction defines the set of validators. If a validator bonds with a sufficient bid in era N, it will be a validator in era N + auction_delay + 1. | 1|
|locked_funds_period | The period after genesis during which a genesis validator's bid is locked. | '90days'|
|vesting_schedule_period | The period in which the genesis validator's bid is released over time after it is unlocked. | '13 weeks'|
|unbonding_delay | Default number of eras that need to pass to be able to withdraw unbonded funds. | 7|
|round_seigniorage_rate | Round seigniorage rate represented as a fraction of the total supply.<br />- Annual issuance: 8%.<br />- Minimum block time: 2^15 milliseconds.<br />- Ticks per year: 31536000000.<br /><br />(1+0.08)^((2^15)/31536000000)-1 is expressed as a fractional number below in Python:<br />`Fraction((1 + 0.08)**((2**15)/31536000000) - 1).limit_denominator(1000000000)` | [7, 87535408]|
|max_associated_keys | Maximum number of associated keys for a single account. | 100|
|max_runtime_call_stack_height | Maximum height of the contract runtime call stack. | 12|
|minimum_delegation_amount | Minimum allowed delegation amount in motes. | 500_000_000_000|
|prune_batch_size | Global state prune batch size for tip pruning in version 1.4.15. Possible values:<br />- 0 when the feature is OFF<br />- Integer if the feature is ON, representing the number of eras to process per block.| 0|
|strict_argument_checking | Enables strict arguments checking when calling a contract; i.e., all non-optional args are provided and they are of the correct `CLType`. | false|
|simultaneous_peer_requests | Number of simultaneous peer requests. | 5|
|consensus_protocol | The consensus protocol to use. Options are 'Zug' or 'Highway'. | 'Highway'|
|max_delegators_per_validator | The maximum amount of delegators per validator. If the value is 0, there is no maximum capacity. | 1200|

|----------------- |-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|maximum_round_length | Highway dynamically chooses its round length between `minimum_block_time` and `maximum_round_length`. | '132seconds'|
|reduced_reward_multiplier | The factor by which rewards for a round are multiplied if the greatest summit has ≤50% quorum, i.e., no finality. Expressed as a fraction (1/5 by default on Mainnet). | [1, 5]|

## deploys
