# Operators

Operators who wish to run node infrastructure on the Casper network, either as a standalone private network, or as part of the public network should explore this guide.

It is recommended that you have prior knowledge of Unix-based operating systems and proficiency with systemd and bash scripting. If you are unfamiliar with systemd, the [Arch Linux page on systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd) is a good introduction to using it.
