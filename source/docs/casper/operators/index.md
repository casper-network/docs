# Operators Overview

Operators who wish to run node infrastructure on a Casper network, either as a standalone private network, or as part of the public network should explore this section.

Prior knowledge of Unix-based operating systems and proficiency with `systemd` and `bash` scripting are recommended. If you are unfamiliar with `systemd`, the [Arch Linux page on systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd) is a good introduction.

Operators should know the [hardware requirements](./setup/hardware.md) before running a node.

Also, the [network requirements](./setup/install-node.md/#network-requirements) specify how to open ports and modify the network firewall to which the node is connected. This step is necessary to allow incoming connections, enabling communication among nodes.

Review the [node's configuration](./setup/basic-node-configuration.md) first. Then, you can follow the node [installation instructions](./setup/install-node.md).
