# Recommended Hardware Specifications

## System Requirements {#system-requirements}

The following hardware specifications are recommended for the **MainNet** and **TestNet**:

-   4 Cores
-   32 GB Ram
-   2 TB SSD or network SSD backed disk
-   Linux machine running Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 (preferred)

:::note Notes

- SDD is required because HDD cannot perform random writes at the performance needed to keep in sync with the full speed of the network.
- For non-archival nodes, disc usage will drop once data recovery is implemented. It is safe to slowly increase the disc space as needed while monitoring on a server capable of this.
