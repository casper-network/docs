# Casper Client Setup

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

1.  You have completed the [Getting Started tutorial](dapp-dev-guide/writing-contracts/getting-started.md) to set up your development environment, including tools like _cmake_ (version 3.1.4+), _cargo_, and _Rust_.
2.  You have completed the [NCTL tutorial](/dapp-dev-guide/building-dapps/setup-nctl), which introduces you to the CLI tool to set up and control local Casper networks for development.

## Installing the Casper Client {#installing-the-casper-client}

The [Prerequisites](/workflow/setup/#the-casper-command-line-client) page lists installation instructions for the Casper client.

Once you have the _casper-client_ installed, we can proceed to walk through setting up NCTL, cloning the contract, and deploying it to the chain.

Before we go through the tutorial, we will give a high-level overview of this tutorial's walkthrough and briefly summarize the relevant commands (and respective arguments).
