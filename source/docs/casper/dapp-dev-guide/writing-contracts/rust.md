# Rust

This section explains step by step how to write a new smart contract on Casper. Start with `main.rs` from the previous section.

## A Basic Smart Contract in Rust {#a-basic-smart-contract-in-rust}

The Casper VM executes a smart contract by calling the `call` function specified in the contract. If the function is missing, the smart contract is not valid. The simplest possible example is an empty `call` function.

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {}
```

The `#[no_mangle]` attribute prevents the compiler from changing (mangling) the function name when converting to the binary format of Wasm. Without it, the VM exits with the error message: `Module doesn't have export call`.

## Arguments {#arguments}

It's possible to pass arguments to smart contracts. To leverage this feature, use [runtime::get_named_arg](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/runtime/fn.get_named_arg.html).

```rust
use casperlabs_contract::contract_api::runtime;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {
    let value: String = runtime::get_named_arg("value");
}
```

## Storage {#storage}

Saving and reading values to and from the blockchain is a manual process in Casper. It requires more code to be written, but also provides a lot of flexibility. The storage system works similarly to a file system in an operating system. Let's say we have a string `"Hello Casper!"` that needs to be saved. To do this, use the text editor, create a new file, paste the string in and save it under a name in some directory. The pattern is similar on the Casper blockchain. First you have to save your value to the memory using [storage::new_uref](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/storage/fn.new_uref.html). This returns a reference to the memory object that holds the `"Hello Casper!"` value. You could use this reference to update the value to something else. It's like a file. Secondly you have to save the reference under a human-readable string using [runtime::put_key](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/runtime/fn.put_key.html). It's like giving a name to the file. The following function implements this scenario:

```rust
const KEY: &str = "special_value";

fn store(value: String) {
    // Store `value` under a new unforgeable reference.
    let value_ref = storage::new_uref(value);

    // Wrap the unforgeable reference in a `Key`.
    let value_key: Key = value_ref.into();

    // Store this key under the name "special_value" in context-local storage.
    runtime::put_key(KEY, value_key);
}
```

After this function is executed, the context (Account or Smart Contract) will have the content of the `value` stored under `KEY` in its named keys space. The named keys space is a key-value storage that every context has. It's like a home directory.

## Final Smart Contract {#final-smart-contract}

The code below is the simple contract generated by [cargo-casper](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-casper) (found in `contract/src/main.rs` of a project created by the tool). It reads an argument and stores it in the memory under a key named `"special_value"`.

```rust
#![cfg_attr(
    not(target_arch = "wasm32"),
    crate_type = "target arch should be wasm32"
)]
#![no_main]

use casperlabs_contract::{
    contract_api::{runtime, storage},
};
use casperlabs_types::{Key, URef};

const KEY: &str = "special_value";
const ARG_MESSAGE: &str = "message";

fn store(value: String) {
    // Store `value` under a new unforgeable reference.
    let value_ref: URef = storage::new_uref(value);

    // Wrap the unforgeable reference in a value of type `Key`.
    let value_key: Key = value_ref.into();

    // Store this key under the name "special_value" in context-local storage.
    runtime::put_key(KEY, value_key);
}

// All session code must have a `call` entrypoint.
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {
    // Get the optional first argument supplied to the argument.
    let value: String = runtime::get_named_arg(ARG_MESSAGE);
    store(value);
}
```

## Using Error Codes {#using-error-codes}

The Casper VM supports error codes in smart contracts. A contract can stop execution and exit with a given error via the [runtime::revert](https://docs.rs/casper-contract) function:

```rust
use casperlabs_contract::contract_api::runtime;
use casperlabs_types::ApiError;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn call() {
    runtime::revert(ApiError::PermissionDenied)
}
```

<!-- Casper has [several built-in error variants](https://crates.io/crates/casper-types/latest/casper_types/) , but it's possible to create a custom set of error codes for your smart contract. These can be passed to [runtime::revert](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/contract_api/runtime/fn.revert.html) via [ApiError::User(\<your error code>) \<https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/enum.ApiError.html#variant.User>](). -->

When a contract exits with an error code, the exit code is visible in the Block Explorer.

### Tests {#tests}

Refer to the [Testing Contract](/docs/dapp-dev-guide/testing) section to view more details about the smart contract testing procedure.

### WASM File Size {#wasm-file-size}

We encourage shrinking the WASM file size as much as possible. Smaller deploys cost less and save the network bandwidth. We recommend reading [Shrinking .wasm Code Size](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/code-size.html) chapter of [The Rust Wasm Book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).
