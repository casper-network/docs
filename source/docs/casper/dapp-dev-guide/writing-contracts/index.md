# Writing Smart Contracts

This section shows you how to write smart contracts in Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm).

| Title                                       | Description                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
|[Getting Started with Rust](../getting-started.md)| An introduction to using Rust with the Casper Platform|
|[A Basic Smart Contract in Rust](rust.md)   | An example of a smart contract built in Rust|
|[A Basic Smart Contract in AssemblyScript](assembly-script.md) | An example of a smart contract built in AssemblyScript |

Additionally, the following tutorials outline some aspects of writing smart contracts on the Casper Network.
