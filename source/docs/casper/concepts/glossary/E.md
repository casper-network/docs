## Ecosystem {#ecosystem}

The ecosystem layer in Casper encompasses dApp design and operation.

## Entry point {#entry-point}

See [EntryPoint](../../developers/json-rpc/types_chain.md#entrypoint) and [Defining the Contract Entry Points](../../developers/writing-onchain-code/simple-contract.md#step-4-defining-the-contract-entry-points).

## Era {#era}

A period of time during which the validator set does not change.

In a Casper network, validators cannot join and leave at any point in time, but only at era boundaries. An era's validators are determined using an [auction](./A.md#auction). At the beginning of the era, the validators create a new instance of the Highway protocol and run this consensus protocol until they finalize the era's last block (see [booking block](./B.md#booking-block)).

## Eviction {#eviction}

Validators that fail to participate in [era](./E.md#era) will have their bid deactivated by the protocol, suspending their participation until they signal readiness to resume participation by invoking a method in the [auction contract](./A.md#auction-contract).

## External client {#external-client}

Any hardware/software connecting to a Node for the purpose of sending deploys or querying the state of the blockchain.
