## Mainnet {#mainnet}

The live, decentralized, and public Casper platform, with version 1.0.

## Merkle tree {#merkle-tree}

A hash tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes.

## Motes {#motes}

A mote is the native accounting unit for a Casper network. All accounting done within a Casper network occurs through motes, with the [CSPR](./C.md#CSPR) token existing as a human-readable convenience wherein a single CSPR consists of 1,000,000,000 motes.

## Multi-Sig {#multisig}

Short for `Multi-Signature`. Accounts on a Casper network can associate other accounts to allow or require a multiple signature scheme for deploys. More information on the use of Multi-Sig can be found [here](../workflow/developers/deploy-transfer.md).
