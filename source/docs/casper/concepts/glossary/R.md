## Reward {#reward}

Validators receive rewards for participating in consensus and finalizing blocks. There is no precise per-block reward. Rewards are split proportionally among stakes within an era. If a validator is offline or cannot vote on many blocks, the rewards earned are also reduced. Delegators can only receive a proportional amount of the validator's rewards minus the validator's [delegation rate](./D.md#delegation-rate). Rewards are distributed at the end of each era.

## Root hash {#root-hash}

The root hash, or Merkle Root, is a representation of all the data in a given hash tree. Refer to [Merkle tree](./M.md#merkle-tree) if you wish to learn more.

## Rust {#rust}

A programming language similar to C++, designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.

## Rustdocs {#rustdocs}

As part of the Rust development environment, the Rustdocs describe the the [Casper contracts library](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/), the [Casper types library](https://docs.rs/casper-types/), and the [Casper test support library](https://docs.rs/casper-engine-test-support/).
