A hash is the output of a cryptographic function that creates a fixed-length output from an input of any length. Casper networks use the [blake2b](./B.md#blake2b) function.

## Highway {#highway}

A consensus protocol that allows clients to use different confidence thresholds to convince themselves that a given block is _finalized_. The full paper is found in GitHub: <https://github.com/casper-network/highway>.
