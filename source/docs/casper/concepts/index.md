# Concepts Overview

The Casper blockchain is a [Turing-complete](./glossary/T.md#turing-complete-blockchain) smart-contracting platform using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and WebAssembly (Wasm). The [Casper Mainnet](https://cspr.live/) is permissionless, decentralized, and public. Network administrators can also create private or hybrid Casper networks as described [here](../operators/setup-network/index.md).

## Concepts

This section of the documentation covers the core concepts underpinning the Casper blockchain. Working with Casper requires an understanding of blockchain technology, as well as some Casper-specific features. We recommend starting with the topics below if you are new to Casper.

## Next Steps

After learning the basic concepts underpinning the Casper protocol, you may wish to look into the following categories.

### Developers

The [Developers](../developers/index.md) area caters to those interested in building dApps and writing smart contracts, including information about specific features or Casper APIs.

### Operators

The [Operators](../operators/index.md) section caters to those who want to run and administrate a Casper node or network.

### Users

The [Users](../users/index.md) section contains tutorials for those interested in interacting with the Casper blockchain using a block explorer or a Ledger device.

### Resources

Navigate to [Resources](../resources/index.md) to try various tutorials. If you are just getting started and looking to build your first Casper-based dApp, start with the [beginner tutorials](../resources/beginner/index.md). Afterward, continue with more [advanced tutorials](../resources/advanced/index.md) to explore the multi-signature feature, runtime return values, and other essential features.
