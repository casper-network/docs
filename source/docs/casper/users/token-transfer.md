# Transferring Tokens using a Block Explorer

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

You can transfer Casper tokens (CSPR) using any [block explorer](./block-explorer.md) built to explore the Casper blockchain. The Wallet feature on these block explorers can be used to transfer tokens to another user's purse, delegate stake, or undelegate stake. In this section, we will discuss the steps to transfer CSPR tokens.

## Transferring Tokens 

To transfer tokens, follow these steps:
1. Sign in to your account with the Signer. For detailed instructions, see the [Signer Guide](https://docs.cspr.community/docs/user-guides/SignerGuide.html).
2. Click **Wallet** on the top menu bar and select **Transfer CSPR** from the drop-down menu. 
3. Enter the recipientâ€™s public key, the amount you wish to transfer, and an optional Transfer ID for reference. 
    If you do not provide an ID, the system will auto-generate one.
4. Click **Next** to proceed. The following figure shows an example transfer of 50 CSPR.

    -   The Recipient public key of the person receiving your transfer
    -   The Recipient account hash used by the system to track the transaction
    -   The Transfer Amount containing the value of the transfer
