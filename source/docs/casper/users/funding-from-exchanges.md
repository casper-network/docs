# Funding Mainnet Accounts from an Exchange

To send CSPR tokens from an exchange to a Mainnet account, you need the **Mainnet account's public key**. Then, you can set up a withdrawal request from the exchange using this public key. The transfer will take a few minutes. 

This guide demonstrates a withdrawal from [Coinlist](https://coinlist.co/) to the Casper Mainnet using the [cspr.live](https://cspr.live/) block explorer. You need to contact the exchange for instructions if you are working with a different exchange.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, copy the public key where you wish to transfer funds. The screenshot below shows the account page on [cspr.live](https://cspr.live/) and the field you need to specify in the withdrawal request from Coinlist.

## Transfers from Coinlist to Casper Mainnet

Try these steps with a small amount of CSPR first. After one successful transfer, you will be more comfortable transferring larger amounts.

1. Log into your [coinlist.co](https://coinlist.co/) account.
2. Go to the "Wallet" tab.

6. Enter 0 in the "Transfer ID" field or another value that is meaningful to you. **You MUST enter a value, or the transfer will fail!**

7. Enter the CSPR amount you wish to transfer.

8. Click "Review".

9. Submit the transfer request. Wait approximately 5 minutes, and then go to the [cspr.live](https://cspr.live/) site to verify your account details. On the account page, you should see that the "Liquid Account Balance" reflects the amount you have transferred.
