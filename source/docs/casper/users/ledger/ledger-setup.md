# Ledger Setup with Casper

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

A Ledger device is a hardware wallet considered one of the most secure ways to store your digital assets. Ledger uses an offline, or cold storage, method of generating private keys, making it a preferred method for many crypto users. 

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

1. Configure your Ledger and the Ledger Live application as described in the [Getting Started with Ledger Live](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389503889?docs=true) article.
2. **<span style={{color:"#ee5945"}}>CRITICAL</span>**: Write down and hide your recovery codes! These are necessary to be able to restore your account if you lose or damage the hardware key.
3. Make sure the Ledger Live application version is at least at `2.73.1`, which is the version that includes Casper accounts.

## Sending and Receiving Tokens

To send and receive CSPR tokens using the accounts on your Ledger device, you have two options:

1. [Manage Casper Accounts using Ledger and Ledger Live](./ledger-live.md)
2. [Manage Casper Accounts using Ledger and CSPR.live](./ledger-cspr-live.md)

To stake CSPR tokens with a validator on the Casper Mainnet, you need to use the CSPR.live block explorer, as described in [Delegating with Ledger Devices](./staking-ledger.md).

Buying, selling, or swapping CSPR are not currently supported in Ledger Live. For these operations, you need to visit an exchange.
