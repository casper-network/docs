# A Counter on an NCTL Network

This tutorial installs a simple counter contract on a local Casper network with NCTL. The contract is straightforward and simply maintains a counter variable. If you want to learn to send deploys to the Testnet, you can follow a [similar tutorial](../counter-testnet/index.md). Once you are familiar with this process, the next step would be to write more practical smart contracts.

Here is how the tutorial is structured:

- [Tutorial Overview](./overview.md) - Introduction to the process and what will be covered
- [Casper-Client Commands](./commands.md) - A summary of all relevant commands and respective arguments
- [Tutorial Walkthrough](./walkthrough.md) - Step-by-step tutorial instructions 

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

1.  You have completed the [Getting Started tutorial](../../../developers/writing-onchain-code/getting-started.md) to set up your development environment, including tools like _cmake_ (version 3.1.4+), _cargo_, and _Rust_.
2.  You have completed the [NCTL tutorial](../../../developers/dapps/setup-nctl.md), which introduces you to the CLI tool to set up and control local Casper networks for development.
3. You have installed the [Casper client](../../../developers/prerequisites.md#the-casper-command-line-client) to send deploys to the chain.
