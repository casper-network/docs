# The Native Multi-Signature Feature

In this [tutorial](./multi-sig-management.md), you will use [Casper's permissions model](../../../concepts/design/casper-design.md#accounts-permissions) to integrate key management on Casper accounts and sign deploys with multiple keys. The corresponding GitHub respository is [here](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/tutorials-example-wasm/tree/dev/multi-sig).

The [additional examples](./other-scenarios.md) present use cases where Casper's multi-signature feature would be helpful.
