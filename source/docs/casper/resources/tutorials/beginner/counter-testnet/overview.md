# Overview

This flowchart outlines the process you will go through in this tutorial. Since there are quite a few things taking place, you must keep in mind the overall flow as you proceed through the tutorial on your own.

To summarize the flowchart, this tutorial will walk you through installing a contract on the blockchain and then calling two separate contract entry points to increment a counter variable. Along the way, you will learn how to query the network state to see when the network has successfully incremented the counter.
