# Introduction

The following topics describe how to use the Casper command-line client to transfer tokens between purses on a Casper network. Depending on the type of accounts, you can choose a direct transfer or a multiple-signature (multi-sig) deploy transfer.  

**Transferring Tokens using Direct Transfer**

You can use the direct method to transfer tokens when you have an account with a single primary key, and it is capable of signing a transaction. To use a direct transfer, see [Transferring Tokens using Direct Transfer](./direct-token-transfer.md).

**Transferring Tokens using Multi-sig Deploy**

When the account used to initiate the transfer has multiple associated keys that need to sign the deploy, you can use a multi-sig deploy transfer. To set up the account's associated keys, see the [Two-Party Multi-Signature Deploys](../../../resources/tutorials/advanced/two-party-multi-sig.md) workflow. To use a multi-sig deploy transfer, see [Transferring Tokens using a Multi-sig Account](./multisig-deploy-transfer.md).

**Verifying a Transfer using the Command-line Client**

To verify the status of a transfer, see [Verifying a Transfer](./verify-transfer.md).
