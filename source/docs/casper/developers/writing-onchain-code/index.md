# Writing On-Chain Code

This section shows you how to write session code and smart contracts in Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm) for a Casper network. When referring to session code, these documents outline logic that executes in the context of an account. In contrast, smart contracts consist of logic installed on-chain, for use by multiple parties. There is a large overlap between the processes of writing session code versus contract code, with some semantic differences outlined in their respective documentation. The [Video Series for Writing On-Chain Code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8oWxbJ-csEqi5FP87EJZViE2aLz6X1Mj) accompanies the topics below.
