# Developers Overview

This section supports developers getting started with the Casper blockchain by writing dApps or smart contracts in Rust. Developers can install a local development environment with a runtime and a test framework. They can also create and test contracts with the libraries provided or use these libraries to build decentralized applications. Prior knowledge of Unix-based operating systems, like GNU/Linux, and programming knowledge with Rust, AssemblyScript, JavaScript, or Python are highly recommended.

| Topic                    | Description                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| [Development Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) | Setup needed for various workflows |
| [Essential Casper Crates](./essential-crates.md) | Available Casper crates and the corresponding documentation |
| [Writing On-Chain Code](./writing-onchain-code/index.md) | Writing contracts in Rust and Wasm for a Casper network |
| [Casper JSON-RPC API](./json-rpc/index.md) | Endpoints for developers wishing to interact directly with a Casper node's JSON-RPC API |
| [Building dApps](./dapps/index.md) | Useful information for dApp developers |
| [Interacting with the Blockchain Using CLI](./cli/index.md) | Using a Rust command-line client to install and call contracts; transfer, delegate, and undelegate tokens. |

The [Ecosystem Open-Source Software](../resources/casper-open-source-software.md) may provide other helpful examples. 

The motivation for the Casper Network roadmap is inspired by community feedback and recommendations. We look forward to building a decentralized future together.
