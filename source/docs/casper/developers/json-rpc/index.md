# Introduction

This document outlines the JSON-RPC API endpoints and types definitions for developers crafting an SDK for use with Casper networks.

## Creating a Casper SDK

The Casper Association provides a JavaScript SDK that is compliant with this SDK Standard. However, those that prefer other languages may build an SDK using their language of choice.

For examples of such SDKs, please refer to our [SDK Client Libraries](../dapps/sdk/index.md) section.

### Serialization

The Casper platform uses a custom serialization format. To this end, we've established a [serialization standard](../../concepts/serialization-standard.md) that describes the format, which SDK developers must implement in their language of choice.
