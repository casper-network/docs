# Interacting with the Casper JSON-RPC API

Casper uses a custom JSON-RPC implementation known as `casper-json-rpc` that is compliant with the [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification). If you are on this page, you are an advanced user wishing to interact directly with a Casper node's JSON-RPC API. You may use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or write code to interact with the Casper JSON-RPC API, which is fully compatible with the JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification.

Casper nodes provide the RPC schema on port `8888`, followed by `rpc-schema`:  

```sh
<HOST:8888>/rpc-schema 
```

To see an example, navigate to a node's RPC schema using a browser.

The Casper client subcommand `list-rpcs` provides all currently supported RPCs. Here is an example of running the Casper client to list RPCs:

```sh
casper-client list-rpcs --node-address <HOST:PORT>
```
