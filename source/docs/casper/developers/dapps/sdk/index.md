# Introduction to SDKs

This section covers the software development kits (SDKs) published by third parties available for interacting with the Casper blockchain. These SDKs are client-side libraries providing functions or methods (depending on the language) to interact with a Casper network. You can use them as a model to develop your application and accomplish tasks such as generating account keys, sending transfers, or other blockchain transactions.

Each of these SDKs can be used to build dApps. For browser interaction you can use the JavaScript SDK, for desktop applications there is C#, Java, etc. Click the link on your preferred SDK to learn how to use it in dApp development. You may visit the SDKs' Github repositories to delve into the source code.
