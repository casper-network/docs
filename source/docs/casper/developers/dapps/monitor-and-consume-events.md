# Monitoring and Consuming Events

The Casper platform uses event streaming to signal state changes in smart contracts and nodes. Using Casper's client-side SDKs, dApps actively listening for emitted events can consume these events and perform actions based on event data.

Each Casper node streams events through the SSE (Server Sent Event) server via the port specified as the `event_stream_server.address` in the node's *config.toml*. This port is by default `9999` for nodes on [Testnet](https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/peers) and [Mainnet](https://cspr.live/tools/peers).

Events are divided into three categories and streamed on their respective endpoints:

- **Deploy events** - Associated with [Deploys](../../concepts/design/casper-design.md#execution-semantics-deploys) on a node. Currently, only a `DeployAccepted` event is emitted. The URL to consume deploy-related events on Mainnet and Testnet is `http://<HOST>:9999/events/deploys/`.
- **Finality Signature events** - Emitted when a block has been finalized and cannot be altered. The URL to consume finality signature events on Mainnet and Testnet is `http://<HOST>:9999/events/sigs/`.
- **Main events** - All other events fall under this type, including: `BlockAdded`, `DeployProcessed`, `DeployExpired`, `Fault`, `Step`, and `Shutdown` events. The URL to consume these events on Mainnet and Testnet is `http://<HOST>:9999/events/main/`.

:::note

An `ApiVersion` event is always emitted when a new client connects to a node's SSE server, informing the client of the node's software version.

:::

## Listening to the Event Stream

Applications can listen for such events for a specific account during a particular era, containing certain data. Then, they can parse the data and discard what they do not need. To consume the event stream, set up an event listener in your dApp using the following code:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { EventStream, EventName } = require("casper-js-sdk")

const es = new EventStream("http://NODE_ADDRESS:9999/events/" + CHANNEL)
es.start()
es.subscribe(EventName.EVENT_NAME, eventHandler)

const eventHandler = (event) => {
    console.log(event)
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
from pycspr import NodeClient, NodeConnection, NodeEventChannel, NodeEventType

def eventHandler(event):
    print(event)

client = NodeClient(NodeConnection(host = "NODE_ADDRESS", port_rpc = 7777))
client.get_events(eventHandler, NodeEventChannel.CHANNEL, NodeEventType.EVENT_NAME)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -s http://NODE_ADDRESS:9999/events/CHANNEL
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You can find node addresses of active online peers to replace `NODE_ADDRESS`, by navigating to [cspr.live](https://cspr.live/tools/peers) for Mainnet and [testnet.cspr.live](https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/peers) for Testnet.

Replace `EVENT_NAME` with one of the event types listed [below](#event-types).

Replace `CHANNEL` with one of the following event streams:
- `main` for `ApiVersion`, `BlockAdded`, `DeployExpired`, `DeployProcessed`, `Fault`, or `Step` events.
- `deploys` for `DeployAccepted` events.
- `sigs` for `FinalitySignature` events.

## Event Types

### ApiVersion

The `ApiVersion` event is always the first event emitted when a new client connects to a node's SSE server. It specifies the protocol version of a node on the Casper platform. The following example contains the JSON representation of the `ApiVersion` event structure.

```bash
data:{"ApiVersion":"1.0.0"}
```

### BlockAdded

A `BlockAdded` event is emitted when a new block is added to the blockchain and stored locally in the node.

## Reacting to Events

An application may parse each event needed for its use case and respond accordingly. The dApp may act on some events and not others, or it may act upon them all, depending on its use case. Each event type contains additional data that might help in deciding whether or not to take an action. For example, `DeployAccepted` events contain the account's public key that submitted the deploy, the contract address, and more. This information can help determine how to proceed or whether or not to react.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
const eventHandler = (event) => {
  if (event.body.DeployAccepted.header.account == "012481699f9231e36ecf002675cd7186b48e6a735d10ec1b30f587ca716937752c") {
    // Perform an action
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
def eventHandler(event):
  if event["DeployAccepted"]["header"]["account"] == "012481699f9231e36ecf002675cd7186b48e6a735d10ec1b30f587ca716937752c":
    # Perform an action
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Unsubscribing from Events

In many cases, an application may need to unsubscribe after a certain time or may want to unsubscribe from some events but not others. The Casper SDKs provide this ability with the `unsubscribe` function:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
es.unsubscribe(EventName.EVENT_NAME)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- `EVENT_NAME` - One of the different [event types](#event-types) emitted by a Casper node.

## Stopping the Event Stream

A dApp may cease listening to all events using the `stop` function:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript
es.stop()
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Replaying the Event Stream

This command will replay the event stream from an old event onward. Replace the `NODE_ADDRESS`, `CHANNEL`, and `ID` fields with the values of your scenario.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
curl -sN http://NODE_ADDRESS:9999/events/CHANNEL?start_from=ID
```

*Example:*

```bash
curl -sN http://65.21.235.219:9999/events/main?start_from=29267508
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Each URL can have a query string added to the form `?start_from=ID`, where ID is an integer representing an old event ID. With this query, you can replay the event stream from that old event onward. If you specify an event ID already purged from the cache, the server will replay all the cached events.

:::note

The server keeps only a limited number of events cached to allow replaying the stream to clients using the `?start_from=` query string. The cache size can be set differently on each node using the `event_stream_buffer_length` value in the *config.toml*. By default, it is only 5000. 
The intended use case is to allow a client consuming the event stream that loses its connection to reconnect and catch up with events that were emitted while it was disconnected.

:::
