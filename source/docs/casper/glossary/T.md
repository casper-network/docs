## Turing-complete blockchain {#turing-complete-blockchain}

Turing completeness refers to the ability of a machine to execute computational problems on its own by deciding or recognizing data manipulation rule sets.

For a blockchain to be Turing-complete, it means that it can understand and execute any smart contract given enough resources such as a robust code-base (necessary instructions), time, processing power, memory, etc. without human interaction or interference.
