# Casper Signer User Guide

## 1. Introduction

The Casper Signer allows you to safely access your Casper Token (CSPR) wallet. The CSPR wallet can be used to transfer CSPR tokens to another user, delegate stake, or ungelegate stake. The Casper Signer can be used for more than one CSPR account and all the accounts are securely stored in a vault, which is a mechanism to protect online information with a password. You set a password for the vault while creating a Casper Signer account. To login using Casper Signer, you must download and install the CasperLabs Signer extension for your browser. The following sections take you through the process of downloading and signing in to the Casper Signer.

> **Note**: These steps use the [cspr.live](https://cspr.live/) as an example, you can install and setup your Signer account on any Casper Network [block explorer](../block-explorer/). 

### 1.1 Installing the CasperLabs Signer Extension

To install the CaperLabs Signer extension, follow these steps:

:::note

Alternatively, you can use this link to download the [CasperLabs Signer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/casperlabs-signer/djhndpllfiibmcdbnmaaahkhchcoijce) extension and skip to _Step 4_.

:::

1. Navigate to [cspr.live](https://cspr.live/), using Chrome or a Chromium-based browser like Brave.

### 1.2 Logging in to the Casper Signer

To log in to the Casper Signer, you must create a vault and import or create accounts. To create a vault, follow these steps:

1. Next to the address bar of your browser, you will find the extensions icon. Click the extensions icon <img src={useBaseUrl("/image/tutorials/signer/ext-icon.png")} class="inline-img" width="25"/> and select CasperLabs Signer from the list.

    1. If you are logging in for the first time, a pop-up window to create a new vault will appear.
    2. On the New Vault pop-up window, enter a password for your vault, confirm the password, and click **CREATE VAULT**. This vault safeguards your Casper accounts, so make sure you use a strong password and keep the password safe.
    
    :::note

    Password requirements:

3. You can now import an account or create a new one.
    1. If you don’t have any existing cryptographic keys, you must create a new account. For more information on creating a new account, see [Creating an Account](#2-creating-an-account).
    2. If you have a set of keys for your account, you can just import the secret key in the Casper Signer. For more information on importing an existing account, see [Importing an Account](#3-importing-an-account).

## 2. Creating an Account

The Casper Signer allows you to create an account and generates a set of keys based on your chosen encryption algorithm. The Casper Network supports these two algorithms:

-   Ed25519 is fast and provides a high level of security with foolproof session keys, among other features. It is the default algorithm used while creating new accounts.
-   Secp256k1 is an efficient encryption algorithm, also used by Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you would like to derive Ethereum or Bitcoin keys in the future using your private key, then choose the Secp256k1 algorithm.

To learn more about cryptographic keys, see [Accounts and Cryptographic Keys](../dapp-dev-guide/keys.md).

To create an account, do the following:

1. On the Casper Signer home (as shown in _Figure 1_), click **CREATE ACCOUNT**. The Create Account fields are displayed.
2. Enter a name for the account and select the algorithm to generate the keys. The Public Key field is auto-populated.
3. Click **CREATE** to create your account.
    1. To return to the Casper Signer home, click the home icon <img src={useBaseUrl("/image/tutorials/signer/home-icon.png")} width="25" class="inline-img" /> on the top-left corner of the pop-up window. Here, you can see the number of accounts in your wallet and the name of the account that is currently active.

:::note

It is highly recommended that you download and save your account keys in a safe location (preferably offline). This will allow you to recover your account in case you lose access to your vault. See [Download Active Key](#44-download-active-key) for more information.
