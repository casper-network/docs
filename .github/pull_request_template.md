- [ ] Docs are successfully building - `yarn install && yarn run build`.
- [ ] For new **internal** links I used *relative file paths* (with .md extension) - e.g. `../../faq/faq-general.md` - instead of introducing *absolute file path*, or *relative/absolute URL*.
- [ ] All external links have been verified with `yarn run check:externals`.
- [ ] My changes follow the [Casper docs style guidelines](https://docs.casper.network/resources/contribute-to-docs/).
- [ ] All technical procedures have been tested (if you want help with this, mention it in [Reviewers](#reviewers)).
- [ ] If structural changes are introduced (not just content changes), cross-broswer testing has been completed.
